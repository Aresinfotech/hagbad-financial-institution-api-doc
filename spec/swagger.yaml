    This page contains the documentation on how to use the Hagbad API.

    **API is in beta version, breaking changes may be introduced before the final release candidate is released**

    # Introduction
    This is the technical documentation for the IT team in charge of integrating Hagbad Moneypool System with their corporate financial platform.

    We must do 3 integrations to start using Hagbad Moneypool Platform as part of your financial offering. 

    The table below illustrates those API integrations: 

    | Operation | Description | API Owner | Integration done by |
    |-----|-----|-------|-------|
    | Into Holding | To send money into a moneypool by one of its members. | Hagbad IT Team | Financial Institution IT Team |
    | Search Customer | To search customers in the financial institution database. | Financial Institution IT Team | Hagbad IT Team |
    | Out of Holding | To send money from a moneypool to one of its members. | Financial Institution IT Team | Hagbad IT Team |
 
     The Hagbad  API is built on top of HTTP:
    - RESTFul
    - Predictable resource URLs. 
    - Accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body. 
    - Returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. 
    
    You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to consume this API. 
     
     
    # Hagbad System
    Please, visit our website: www.hagbad.net
    

    # Authentication

    All Hagbad APIs, including this one, use [OpenId Connect](http://openid.net) protocol to authenticate users. Specifically the security tokens used are JWT tokens. 

    To issue new tokens, you have to use the Hagbad OpenId compliant server located at https://hagbad.greysystems.eu/auth (for more info please check [GreySystems Identity Server Doc](https://grey-systems.github.io/gs-identity-doc/))

    * **User Token**: Gets an `access_token` issued on behalf of an end-user. To get an user access_token you have to implement the [Authorization Code Flow](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/3.3/server_admin/topics/sso-protocols/oidc.html). 

    **How I use the tokens?**
     As stated in the introduction, both tokens types are JWT tokens, and you should set that token in the HTTP `Authorization` Header of the API call in this way: 

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer {the_token}
    ```

    # Common HTTP Error Responses

    The Rest API uses the following common HTTP status codes to communicate general issues or errors to the clients: 

    * HTTP **400** (Invalid Request): The request provided is invalid (request is not well formed, a mandatory field is not provided, etc..). 
    * HTTP **403** (Forbidden): You are not allowed to access or update the requested resource. 
    * HTTP **404** (Not found): The searched item could not be found (the moneypool was not found, etc..). 
    * HTTP **409** (Conflict): There is a conflict when trying to execute the operation (status change not allowed, etc..). 
    * HTTP **500** (Internal Server Error): Some internal component has failed to process your request. Please notify about this error to GreySystems team.

        ## Into Holding Transactions.
    
        Into Holding transactions occur when customers of your financial institution want to send money to an Hagbad Moneypool, in which they are members.

  - name: Customer Search
    description:  | 
        ## Customer Search on Financial Institution Database.
        
        When we register new customers in Hagbad, we want to know if those persons are already customers in your Financial Institution. 

        Therefore, you need to provide us with an API to search customers in your database by mobile number and birthdate.
    
        We will allow people to register in Hagbad Platform, even if they are not customers of your Financial Institution. However, Hagbad customers must be registered on your Financial Institution to send or receive money from a moneypool.

        In this section, we include the input and output that your API should provide to perform customer searchs.
  - name: Out of Holding
    description: | 
        ## Out of Holding Transactions.
    
        Moneypool members need to get paid at some moment. Those payments are the Out of Holding Transaction. 

        We will push those payment orders to your Financial Institution, using the API that you must provide us for this purpose. 

        Please, be aware that there are 2 different payment methods:
        - Cash Pickup
        - Mobile Wallet

        In this section, we include the input and output that your API should provide to perform Out of Holdings.
